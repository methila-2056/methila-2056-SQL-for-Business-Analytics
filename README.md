📊 SQL for Business Analytics
🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for Business Analytics to extract insights from customer churn data.

The objective is to perform data querying, aggregation, and advanced SQL analysis to support business decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Write basic and advanced SQL queries

Perform data aggregation using SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY

Analyze churn patterns and revenue metrics

Generate business KPIs

Optimize query structure for performance

🗂 Dataset

Dataset used: Churn-BigML (80%)

The dataset contains customer-level telecom data including:

Account information

Call charges (Day, Evening, Night, International)

SQL for Business Analytics
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL for Business Analytics using a telecom customer churn dataset. The objective is to extract actionable business insights through structured querying, aggregation, and analytical reporting.

The analysis focuses on identifying churn behavior, revenue trends, customer segmentation, and performance metrics that support data-driven business decisions.

Business Objectives

Develop and execute basic and advanced SQL queries

Perform data aggregation using SUM, AVG, COUNT, and GROUP BY

Analyze churn behavior across customer segments

Generate key business performance indicators (KPIs)

Translate raw transactional data into meaningful insights

Dataset

Dataset: Churn-BigML (80% sample)

The dataset contains telecom customer information including:

Account details

Call usage metrics (Day, Evening, Night, International)

Service interaction records

International plan subscription

Churn status (Target Variable)

Technologies Used

SQL (SQLite)

Python

Pandas

VS Code

SQL Analysis Performed
1. Data Exploration

Retrieve customer records

Filter churned customers

Identify top customers by usage and charges

2. Aggregation & Revenue Analysis

Total customer count

Average charges by time category

Revenue contribution by state

International plan usage comparison

3. Advanced Business Queries

Service call segmentation using CASE statements

Above-average revenue customer identification

Churn comparison across multiple performance metrics

Key Business Metrics

Overall churn rate
